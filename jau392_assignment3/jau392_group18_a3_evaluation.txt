Our team worked largely independently up until Monday, then integrated the two .pde files
and related auxiliary files together into the main assignment folder. We then proceeded to
test our submission against the rubric independently and — once we had reached a unanimous
decision that our collective work satisfied the requirements – submitted.

Muxin was a somewhat slower responder, but made valuable contributions to the Python script
among others. Wynne was a great communicator and the one who chiefly partitioned the tasks,
but had a rather busy schedule.I made the most firsthand contributions to the actual Processing file rough drafts, taking
strong initiative. However, considering I did not realize this HAD to be a group project
until early the last day, my weakness was definitely negligence with checking Canvas inbox.
