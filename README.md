# Programming-Graphic-Design
A few of my projects created using the graphical IDE 'Processing' in Java.

Final Project: A doge-themed, agar.io inspired two dimensional game with fully-operable and self-contained playability. Tracks global player and score data
with a JSON file. Object interactions tracked and modulated with various functions.

Assignment 3: High-volume word frequency calculation and visualization from text files of user's choice.

NOTE: I intended to upload another project, which was a 3-dimensional animation. However, it for some reason won't upload onto GitHub. A link can be found here:

Each of the 3 visible objects features a multilevel heirarchy of animation/interaction.
